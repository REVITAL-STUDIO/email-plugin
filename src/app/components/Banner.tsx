          We're a team of experienced software developers who noticed a major
          gap in how legal professionals manage email. While we don't come from
          law, we've built tools for complex, high-stakes industries â€” and we
          saw how much time, clarity, and security lawyers were losing to
          disorganized inboxes. Our mission: bring clarity, structure, and
          security to legal email without disrupting the way lawyers work.
