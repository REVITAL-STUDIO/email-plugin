            We're a team of experienced software developers who noticed a major
            gap in how legal professionals manage email. While we don't come
            from law, we've built tools for complex, high-stakes industries â€”
            and we saw how much time, clarity, and security lawyers were losing
            to disorganized inboxes. Our mission: bring clarity, structure, and
            security to legal email without disrupting the way lawyers work.
